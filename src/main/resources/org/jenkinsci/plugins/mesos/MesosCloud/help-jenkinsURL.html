<div>
    http://HOST:PORT where Jenkins is actually running. For ex: http://myjenkinshost:8080.
    Jenkins URL provided in Jenkins location configuration could be a reverse proxy URL.
    In that case you can override it by specifying actual Jenkins URL here.
    This URL would be used by Jenkins slaves spawned by Mesos plugin to talk to Jenkins Master.
